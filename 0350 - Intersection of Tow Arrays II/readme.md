# Intersection of two Arrays II

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]<br>
Output: [2,2]<br>

**Example 2:**

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]<br>
Output: [4,9]<br>

Note:
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
Follow up:

What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?<br>
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?<br>
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
