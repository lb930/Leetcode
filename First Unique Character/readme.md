# First Unique Character

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**

s = "leetcode"<br>
return 0.<br>

s = "loveleetcode"<br>
return 2.<br>
 

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.
