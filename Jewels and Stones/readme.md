# Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

**Example 1:**

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
Output: 3<br>

**Example 2:**

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"<br>
Output: 0<br>
 
Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50<br>
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.<br>
All the characters of jewels are unique.<br>
