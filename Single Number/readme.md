# Single number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [2,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: 1
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104<br>
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104<br>
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
